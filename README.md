# Modular Utilities

Welcome! Modular Utilities is the start of a library of developer-experience tools designed to help you keep the gears on your workflow oiled. 
It currently focuses on:
- A high-precision codebase meta-file generator for building LLM context (think: codebase indexing, meta-data headers, different flag options, diagrams, and structure for your codebase).
- A universal, plug-and-play LLM providers layer (swap models/providers with minimal changes and a universal API contract).
- More utilities are planned and on the way.

If you’re a developer looking to improve your workflow, or a curious reader exploring modern tooling patterns, you’re in the right place.

## Why this project?

- Developer-first ergonomics: Practical, minimal ceremony, and composable. Sometimes a single basic tool can provide huge value and time savings to your workflow.
- Batteries-included, but optional: Use what you need. The [Github-dlr](https://github.com/justinlietz93/Modular_Utilities/tree/main/github-dlr) tool lets you pull individual folders from the repo.
- Future-friendly: Interfaces and adapters to help you pivot across providers and tools without rewrites.

## Contents

- Codebase Meta-File Generator
  - Generates structured metadata (indexes, summaries, references) for your repo.
  - Useful for code navigation, documentation, code search, embeddings pipelines, and LLM-augmented tooling.

- Universal LLM Providers (Plug-and-Play)
  - Unified interface to talk to different LLM providers and models.
  - Swap providers via configuration rather than code changes.

- More utilities to come
  - Modular building blocks oriented around DX and AI-assisted development.

---

## Project status

- Early stage / alpha / experimental
- These are best seen as quick cheap tools, unstable and not production ready
- APIs and module boundaries may evolve as features stabilize
- Feedback, ideas, and contributions are very welcome

## Quick start

Because this project is evolving, the most reliable way to try it is to clone and run locally.

1) Clone the repository
- git clone https://github.com/justinlietz93/Modular_Utilities.git
- cd Modular_Utilities

2) Python setup (recommended today)
- Ensure you have Python 3.10+ installed.
- - Create and activate a virtual environment, then install in editable mode:
  - python -m venv .venv
  - source .venv/bin/activate  # on Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
  - pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
  - pip install -e .  # add [dev] if a dev extra is provided in the future

3) Explore the modules
- Check the source modules to see available utilities and their docstrings.
- Many components are designed to be used independently—feel free to pick and choose.

Note: If/when TypeScript packages are published to npm, we’ll add npm/pnpm/yarn install instructions here.

## Examples (lightweight, conceptual)

Below are high-level examples to convey the spirit of the utilities. Names and APIs may differ as the project iterates—consult the source for the current interfaces.

- Codebase meta-file generation (conceptual Python sketch)
  - from modular_utilities.meta import CodebaseIndexer
  - index = CodebaseIndexer(path=".", include=["src", "app"]).build()
  - index.to_json("codebase.index.json")

- Universal LLM provider abstraction (conceptual Python sketch)
  - from modular_utilities.llm import LLM, ProviderConfig
  - llm = LLM.from_config(ProviderConfig(provider="openai", model="gpt-4o-mini", api_key="..."))
  - response = llm.complete("Summarize this repository in two sentences.")
  - print(response.text)

As stable APIs land, we’ll include fully runnable examples and notebooks.

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] Solidify stable interfaces for meta-file generation and LLM abstraction
- [ ] Add provider adapters (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) behind a unified API
- [ ] Expand TypeScript utilities to parity where it makes sense
- [ ] Example scripts and notebooks
- [ ] Documentation website (guides, patterns, recipes)
- [ ] Benchmarks and integration tests

If there’s a feature you want, please open an issue with details about your use case.

---

## Contributing

Contributions of all sizes are welcome:
- Suggest features or improvements via issues
- Submit PRs for bug fixes, docs, or new utilities
- Share patterns and examples that helped you

Suggested flow:
1) Open an issue to discuss your idea (optional but helpful).
2) Fork, create a feature branch, and make changes.
3) Write a concise PR explaining the “why” and the “how.”

Please keep code modular and well-documented—this project values clarity and composability.
